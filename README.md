# Baseline.js

Baseline.js is a simple jQuery plugin for restoring baselines thrown off by odd image sizes.

Simply call the plugin like so, passing the height of your baseline as a variable. It even works on responsive designs!

```javascript
// call like so
baseline.init('img', '24');
baseline.init('.post img', '48');
```
